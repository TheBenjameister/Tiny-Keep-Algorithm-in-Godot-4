# Tiny Keep Algorithm in Godot 4

This code is an implementation of the procedural dungeon generation algorithm for the game Tiny Keep, commonly known as the Tiny Keep Algorithm.

As far as I am aware, this is the first implementation of this algorithm in GDScript 4. 

There are still bugs and it looks very ugly, but the main functionality of the algorithm is there. 

This algorithm is *not* efficient by any means, it took me an absurd amount of time to code this and the code I've uploaded is just whatever worked. 

Current bugs I am aware of is that the algorithm sometimes decides it doesn't want to draw corridors connecting key rooms, leading to completely disjointed maps. 

This code is available for public use, and you can modify it as you wish under the MIT liscense. 

I would greatly apreciate any contributions to polish the code. As we are moving toward the next big release of Godot, resources like these are invaluable, and should be improved for the benefit of all the amazing people who will be using this platform and programming language for the years to come.
